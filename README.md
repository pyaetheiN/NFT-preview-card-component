This challenge wasn't very easy, however I learned how to make double image overlay!

Things I learned
 - two ways to code double image overlay
 1. using `:hover::after` pseudo-elements
 2. adding additional containers (html line 24 for context)
 - adding a specific property on transition e.g. `transition: background-color 0.3s;`
 - `inset` CSS property is a shorthand that corresponds to the top, right, bottom, and/or left properties. It has the same multi-value syntax of the margin shorthand. e.g. `inset: 0;` -> `top,right,bot,left = 0;`
